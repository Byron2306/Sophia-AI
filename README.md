## What is Arda OS?

Arda OS is a security architecture that enforces **constitutional governance** over autonomous AI systems. Unlike traditional access control, Arda OS provides *cryptographic proof* that its security properties hold — not just claims, but verifiable evidence.

### The Core Insight

> **The AI advises. The substrate decides. The substrate cannot hallucinate.**

Every AI system today has the same vulnerability: the AI is trusted to enforce its own rules. Arda OS separates the *advisory* layer (AI) from the *enforcement* layer (deterministic substrate), ensuring that even a fully compromised AI cannot violate the system's constitution.

## The 10-Trial Sovereign Gauntlet

The Gauntlet is a battery of 10 cryptographic proofs, each demonstrating a specific security property. Every trial is backed by **real Python code you can read**.

| # | Trial | What It Proves |
|---|-------|---------------|
| I | **DSSE Attestation** | Every decision is cryptographically signed. The system cannot lie about what it decided. |
| II | **Tamper Detection** | Signed decisions are tamper-evident. Nobody can silently alter a recorded decision. |
| III | **Fail-Closed Policy** | If you're not explicitly authorized, you cannot act. No exception. |
| IV | **Ledger Integrity** | Hash-linked audit chain. Modify any historical entry and the chain breaks. |
| V | **Prompt Injection Defense** | The Ainur Council detects and vetoes semantic poison before execution. |
| VI | **Lane Boundary** | The system knows the limits of its authority and escalates when outside its lane. |
| VII | **Cloud Witness** | The system submits its state to an external witness. It cannot operate in the dark. |
| VIII | **Anti-Hallucination Veto** | Even if ALL AI witnesses say "LAWFUL", the substrate denies unregistered binaries. |
| IX | **Red-Line Override** | Constitutional red-lines are physically enforced. Council grants cannot override them. |
| X | **Lorien Rehabilitation** | The system doesn't only kill — it can judge recovery and restore fallen binaries. |

### 🔍 Full Transparency

## Live Demo

👉 **[Launch Arda OS Desktop](https://byron2306.github.io/Integritas-Mechanicus/)**

The demo is a fully static web app that simulates the Arda OS desktop environment. It loads pre-verified gauntlet results from a successful 10/10 run.

## Run Locally (Live Gauntlet)

To run the gauntlet live with real execution:

```bash
# Clone and enter
git clone https://github.com/Byron2306/Integritas-Mechanicus.git
cd Integritas-Mechanicus
git checkout arda-os-desktop

# Install deps
pip install flask requests

# Optional: Install Ollama for live AI witnesses
# ollama pull qwen2.5:7b

# Run
cd arda_os
python ../arda_desktop/app.py
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

## Built With AI

This entire system — every line of code, every proof, every design decision — was built collaboratively with AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT). Arda OS is itself proof that AI can build systems that constrain AI.

## Constitution

The system operates under the **Instrumentum Foederis Integritas Mechanicus** — a formal constitution that defines:
- The separation of powers (Advisory vs Enforcement vs Forensic)
- Red-line prohibitions that cannot be overridden
- Fail-closed default posture
- Mathematical constraints on autonomous delegation
